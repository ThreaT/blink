#### Draft of meshweb ideas:

The idea behind the ideas is to move as much as possible, if not everything, to the application level and make everything subject to competition by avoiding all potential monopolistic paradigms. It would be particularly beneficial in the Internet of Things where various devices are connected to the network and have different security, performance, hardware, scalability and availability concerns.

**Problem**: The web is slow

**Solution**: Use native streamed applications

<hr/>

**Problem**: The standards, protocols and technologies that make up the web have difficult processes for making changes, too much of a learning curve and require constant learning, making it very difficult to start contributing

**Solution**: No more standards

<hr/>

**Problem**: Only some native streamed applications can be trusted

**Solution**: You decide what is trustworthy with optional assitance from other trusted streamed applications

<hr/>

**Problem**: Applications need to work the same on all devices

**Solution**: Application developers should ensure their applications work the same on all devices. An optional open source standard interface could also be reused for any number of applications.

<hr/>

**Problem**: Hosts do not know what native code to stream without more information about the device

**Solution**: New native streamed applications can be created to associate device information with their static ipv6 addresses

<hr/>

**Problem**: It takes too long to develop for all devices

**Solution**: Temporarily trade performance for convenience by using an interpreter like Java

<hr/>

**Problem**: Finding new native streamed applications is impossible without some kind of DNS

**Solution**: Bookmark indexing native streamed applications using the device's operating system

<hr/>

**Problem**: Sending data across a public network will always have spectators and privacy issues

**Solution**: Speak a great number of different *languages* from a greater number of unique *languages* and then speak nonsense

<hr/>

**Problem**: Scalability and High Availability are only as good as your budget

**Solution**: Promote mesh networking
